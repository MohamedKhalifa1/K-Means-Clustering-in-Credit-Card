## Credit Card K-Means Clustering Project
Welcome to the Credit Card K-Means Clustering project! This project explores the utilization of K-Means Clustering to analyze credit card data, focusing on the 'purchases' and 'payments' features. The goal is to uncover distinct spending patterns and glean data-driven insights for personalized strategies.
## Project Highlights
- Objective: Employ K-Means Clustering to segment credit card users based on their transaction behaviors.- Key Features: The project primarily focuses on the 'purchases' and 'payments' attributes for clustering.
- Methodology: Rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and K-Means application were employed.- Impact: The project aims to enable personalized marketing, informed financial planning, and strategic decision-making.
## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- data/: This directory contains the credit card dataset.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and K-Means clustering.- results/: The outcomes of the clustering process, including cluster visualizations and insights.
- README.md: You are here!
